# NSAF calculator

NSAF calculator is a Shiny app created for the calculation of NSAFF (Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor). 
It is developed to support Proteome Discoverer and MSFragger output table format, but if your table comes from another computational platform just adapt the format naming with "AA" the column of the aminoacid length and "PSM" for every column containing PSMs information. For the NSAF calculation the user can choose between the aminoacid length or the molecular weigh of the protein identified.
